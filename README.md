# Advent of Code 2024

Repository storing my solutions for Advent of Code 2024.
Solutions are in whatever language I feel like using that day, but I would guess mostly in Python.

## Running

Each day is stored in a separate `Day XX/language/sol.x` file.
For python, all solutions can be run in one go using the `all.py` script in the root of the repository.
