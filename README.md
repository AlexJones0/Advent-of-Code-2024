# Advent of Code 2024

Repository storing my solutions for Advent of Code 2024.
Solutions are in whatever language I feel like using that day, but I would guess mostly in Python.

## Running

Each day is stored in a separate `Day XX/language/sol.x` file.

For python, you can run an individual day by running e.g. `python3 'Day\ XX/Python/sol.x`.
All solutions can be run in one go using `python3 all.py`.

For Rust, you can run an individual day by running e.g. `cargo run -- --day XX`
All solutions can be run in one go by running normally, e.g. `cargo run`.
